Working Notes

-> add 10 poison items onto the map
-> Poison Life-cycle: 6 more seconds alive
-> Add one poison every 4 seconds, until max poison count is reacher, only add more after a poison dies
-> snake object has a timer object for poison addition





-> implement a 10 poison logic, infinite lifetime
-> then add limited lifetime
-> then add kill snake logic.





???-> add poison move ability; bait?
